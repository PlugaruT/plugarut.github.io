# Hi, I'm Tudor.

I do **software engineering** for a living with _Python_.

Currently building AI-powered customer support tools at [Gorgias](https://gorgias.com/), working on interesting challenges in:
- 🤖 Machine Learning & Natural Language Processing
- 🏗️ Distributed systems and microservices
- 📊 Data pipelines and analytics
- 🚀 Developer experience and tooling

Previously crafted e-commerce experiences at **made.com**, where I learned the art of scaling systems that handle millions of furniture-loving customers.

When I'm not coding, you might find me:
- Contributing to open source projects
- Writing about tech and remote work
- Exploring the beautiful landscapes of Moldova 🇲🇩

Feel free to reach out if you want to discuss Python, distributed systems, or the best coffee shops for remote work!

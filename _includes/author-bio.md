# Hi, I'm Tudor

I do **software engineering** for a living.

Currently, I'm part of the platform streaming team at [Gorgias](https://gorgias.com/) where I'm building real-time features using Python, Apache Flink and Apache Kafka.

When I'm not coding, you might find me:

- Creating and contributing to open source projects
- Reading books, here's my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52045481-tudor-plugaru) profile
- Running, hiking or playing padel, here's my [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/80622861) profile
- Teaching tech to underprivileged youth in Moldova

Feel free to [reach out](mailto:tudor@plugaru.me) if you want to discuss Python, distributed systems, or any other tech topics.
